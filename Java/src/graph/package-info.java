/**
 * Provides the classes which are necessary for creating and performing operations on <i>graphs</i>. In particular,
 * an interface provides the methods necessary to handle operations involving the addition, removal or access to the
 * elements of the graph. Two complementary interfaces contain the methods for these elements, which are <i>vertices</i>
 * and <i>edges</i>. Moreover, the {@code UndirectedGraph} class contains all methods necessary to work with
 * an undirected graph whose number of nodes does not vary.
