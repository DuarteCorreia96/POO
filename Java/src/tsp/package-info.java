/**
 * Provides the classes which are necessary to try to get a solution to the
 * <i>Travelling salesman problem</i> using the <i>ant colony optimization</i>.
 * The main class is used to run a full simulation with values from
 * {@code args[0]} that should be a .xml file with the problem specifications.
 * It uses a discrete stochastic simulation based on a pending event container
 * that is implemented using a {@code PriorityQueue}.
